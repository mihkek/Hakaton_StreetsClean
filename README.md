#Some words about this project

I worked on this project in “Hakaton”. Our team had to create a web-app that could help workers to construct directions for cleaning the roads in the Russian city - Lipeck.
Unfortunately, some problems took place and the project as a whole hasn't been completed. But my task was to create only the frontend, and here it is.

Functions of the application:

To show and edit base information about every route on the map. 
The data about routes and locations of transport on the map is supposed to be received from the backend. You can change transport types, starting and ending zones and you’re able to add/remove control points.

To find any place in the word map using lat and lang.
